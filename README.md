# Birds Image Recognition Task - Kaggle Dataset

The aim of this project is to identify 200 different species of birds from 224x224x3 pixel images. This is an image recognition task and there is no detection or segmentation done on this data. 

I chose this project to develop several skills including: 

- Further experience with the Keras and Tensorflow machine learning libraries.

  - Utilising both in-built and custom callbacks during training 
  - Parameter tuning using keras tuner
  - Transfer learning with a variety of pre-trained models including VGG-16, Xception and Resnet architectures. 
  - Using Tensorboard to evaluate training 'on the fly'. 

- Understand and visualise the 'black box' inside neural networks. 

- Evaluate image recognition tasks

- Train models using GPUs. In this case Google Colab was used for free access to a GPU.

# Introduction to the Challenge

# Data

224x224x3 RGB images are provided at https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/100-bird-species. 

There is a total of 29503 images with 200 different classes or birds. I split the data into a train and test dataset split 80-20%. The number of images per class varies between 97 and 310 with a mean number of images at 148. Below is a histogram of the classes sorted by the number of images for the corresponding class.
